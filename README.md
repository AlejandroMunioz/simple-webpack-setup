# Getting started with Webpack 2

This branch is part of a [blog post](https://www.liquidlight.co.uk/blog/article/getting-started-with-webpack-2/) project written for [Liquid Light](https://www.liquidlight.co.uk/). It explains step by step how to integrate Webpack with Gulp.

For simplicity we use CommonJS on the Javascript modules examples.

To get started, clone the repo to your local machine and run:

```
$ npm install; gulp
```
